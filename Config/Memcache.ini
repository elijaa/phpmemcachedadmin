; Configuration file for phpMemCacheAdmin
;

[api]
; API to use for command :
; - Server
; - Memcache
; - MemCached
;
; use it by editing configuration value like :
; stats = Server
; slabs = Memcache
; items = Memcached
;
; Exemple:
; Communicating directly with Server is better for stats, but get command can't read PECL Memcached stored data
; So use Server for stats, and Memcached for get
;
; REMEMBER :
; - stats from PECL Memcached are very light, so don't use it
; - PECL Memcached does not support slabs and items command
; - PECL Memcached can only read it's own data
; - PECL Memcache can read some of PECL Memcached items

; stats command
stats = "Server"

; slabs command
slabs = "Server"

; items command
items = "Server"

; get command
get = "Server"

; delete command
delete = "Server"


[servers]
; Add new server from template server[] = server_name:port
; don't forget to specify server port (even if 11211)
;
server[] = "localhost:11211"
server[] = "127.0.0.1:11211"
server[] = "loc545454545454545454545454545alhost:11211"
;server[] = ....:11211


[connection]
; Connection timeout to memcached server in seconds
;
connection_timeout = "3"


[items]
;max items dump for slabs item dump
;
max_item_dump = "25"
